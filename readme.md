Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as reverse ≈Åukasiewicz notation, Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to prefix or Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands. The notation does not need any parentheses for as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. - Wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
